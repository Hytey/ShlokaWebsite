This website uses artificial intelligence in order to build your understanding in different spectrums. 
It can summarize text for you, argue with you on a topic for hours, give you ethical dilemas , and can give a detailed explaination on a single topic.
In the first hour i chose the shlokas, and found out their meaning, and then applied those meanings to build different sections of the website.
In the next few hours, i just worked on writing the code for the different fragments.
For applying AI, i used gemini flash's API, and used gemini and chatgpt to explain me how to use the api, and how to tackle those errors .
I generally prefer a dark aesthetic look , so i gave it that look and added few animations.
